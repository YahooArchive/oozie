---+!! Oozie Installation and Configuration

%TOC%

---++ Basic Setup

Follow the instructions at [[DG_QuickStart][Oozie Quick Start]].

---++ Environment Setup

*IMPORTANT:* Oozie ignores any set value for =OOZIE_HOME=, Oozie computes its home automatically.

When running Oozie with its embedded Tomcat server, the =conf/oozie-env.sh= file can be
used to configure the following environment variables used by Oozie:

*CATALINA_OPTS* : settings for the Embedded Tomcat that runs Oozie Java System properties
for Oozie should be specified in this variable. No default value.

*OOZIE_CONFIG_FILE* : Oozie configuration file to load from Oozie configuration directory.
Default value =oozie-site.xml=.

*OOZIE_LOGS* : Oozie logs directory. Default value =logs/= directory in the Oozie installation
directory.

*OOZIE_LOG4J_FILE* :  Oozie Log4J configuration file to load from Oozie configuration directory.
Default value =oozie-log4j.properties=.

*OOZIE_LOG4J_RELOAD* : Reload interval of the Log4J configuration file, in seconds.
Default value =10=

*OOZIE_HTTP_PORT* : The port Oozie server runs. Default value =11000=.

*OOZIE_HTTP_HOSTNAME* : The host name Oozie server runs on. Default value is the output of the
command =hostname -f=.

*OOZIE_BASE_URL* : The base URL for actions callback URLs to Oozie. The default value
is =http://${OOZIE_HTTP_HOSTNAME}:${OOZIE_HTTP_PORT}/oozie=.

*OOZIE_CHECK_OWNER* : If set to =true=, Oozie setup/start/run/stop scripts will check that the
owner of the Oozie installation directory matches the user invoking the script. The default
value is undefined and interpreted as a =false=.

---++ Oozie Server Setup

The =setup-oozie.sh= script prepares the embedded Tomcat server to run Oozie.

The =setup-oozie.sh= script options are:

<verbatim>
Usage  : oozie-setup.sh <OPTIONS>"
         [-extjs EXTJS_PATH] (expanded or ZIP, to enable the Oozie webconsole)"
         [-hadoop HADOOP_VERSION HADOOP_PATH] (Hadoop version [0.20.1|0.20.2|0.20.104|0.20.200]"
                                               and Hadoop install dir)"
         [-jars JARS_PATH] (multiple JAR path separated by ':')"
         (without options does default setup, without the Oozie webconsole)"
</verbatim>

---+++ Setting Up Oozie with an Alternate Tomcat

Use the =addtowar.sh= script to prepare the Oozie server only if Oozie will run with a different
servlet  container than the embedded Tomcat provided with the distribution.

The =addtowar.sh= script adds Hadoop JARs, JDBC JARs and the ExtJS library to the Oozie WAR file.

The =addtowar.sh= script options are:

<verbatim>
 Usage  : addtowar <OPTIONS>
 Options: -inputwar INPUT_OOZIE_WAR
          -outputwar OUTPUT_OOZIE_WAR
          [-hadoop HADOOP_VERSION HADOOP_PATH]
          [-extjs EXTJS_PATH]
          [-jars JARS_PATH] (multiple JAR path separated by ':')
</verbatim>

The original =oozie.war= file is in the Oozie server installation directory.

After the Hadoop JARs and the ExtJS library has been added to the =oozie.war= file Oozie is ready to run.

Delete any previous deployment of the =oozie.war= from the servlet container (if using Tomcat, delete
=oozie.war= and =oozie= directory from Tomcat's =webapps/= directory)

Deploy the prepared =oozie.war= file (the one that contains the Hadoop JARs adn the ExtJS library) in the
servlet container (if using Tomcat, copy the prepared =oozie.war= file to Tomcat's =webapps/= directory).

*IMPORTANT:* Only one Oozie instance can be deployed per Tomcat instance.

---++ Database Configuration

Oozie works with HSQL, Derby, MySQL and Oracle databases.

By default, Oozie is configured to use Embedded Derby.

Oozie bundles the JDBC drivers for HSQL and Embedded Derby.

HSQL is normally used for testcases as it is an in-memory database and all data is lost everytime Oozie is stopped.

If using MySQL or Oracle, the Oozie database schema must be created. By default, Oozie creates its tables automatically.

The =bin/addtowar.sh= and the =oozie-setup.sh= scripts have an option =-jars= that can be used to add the Oracle or
MySQL JDBC driver JARs to the Oozie WAR file.

The SQL database used by Oozie is configured using the following configuration properties (default values shown):

<verbatim>
  oozie.db.schema.name=oozie
  oozie.db.schema.create=true
  oozie.service.StoreService.jdbc.driver=org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver
  oozie.service.StoreService.jdbc.url=jdbc:derby:${oozie.home.dir}/${oozie.db.schema.name}-db;create=true
  oozie.service.StoreService.jdbc.username=sa
  oozie.service.StoreService.jdbc.password=
  oozie.service.StoreService.pool.max.active.conn=10
</verbatim>

*NOTE:* If the =oozie.db.schema.create= property is set to =true= (default) the Oozie tables will be created
automatically if they are not found in the database at Oozie start up time. In a production system this option should
be set to =false= once the databaset tables have been created.

---++ Oozie Configuration

By default, Oozie configuration is read from Oozie's =conf/= directory

The Oozie configuration is distributed in 3 different files:

   * =oozie-site.xml= : Oozie server configuration
   * =oozie-log4j.properties= : Oozie logging configuration
   * =adminusers.txt= : Oozie admin users list

---+++ Oozie Configuration Properties

All Oozie configuration properties and their default values are defined in the =oozie-default.xml= file.

Oozie resolves configuration property values in the following order:

   * If a Java System property is defined, it uses its value
   * Else, if the Oozie configuration file (=oozie-site.xml=) contains the property, it uses its value
   * Else, it uses the default value documented in the =oozie-default.xml= file

*NOTE:* The =oozie-default.xml= file found in Oozie's =conf/= directory is not used by Oozie, it is there
for reference purposes only.

---+++ Logging Configuration

By default, Oozie log configuration is defined in the =oozie-log4j.properties= configuration file.

If the Oozie log configuration file changes, Oozie reloads the new settings automatically.

By default, Oozie logs to Oozie's =logs/= directory.

Oozie logs in 4 different files:

   * oozie.log: web services log streaming works from this log
   * oozie-ops.log: messages for Admin/Operations to monitor
   * oozie-instrumentation.log: intrumentation data, every 60 seconds (configurable)
   * oozie-audit.log: audit messages, workflow jobs changes

The embedded Tomcat and embedded Derby log files are also written to Oozie's =logs/= directory.

---+++ Oozie User Authentication Configuration

*IMPORTANT:* This feature is only available in Cloudera's distribution of Oozie (CDH3b4 onwards).

Oozie supports Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO authentication, pseudo/simple authentication and anonymous access
for client connections.

Anonymous access (*default*) does not require the user to authenticate and the user ID is obtained from
the job properties on job submission operations, other operations are anonymous.

Pseudo/simple authentication requires the user to specify the user name on the request, this must be done
using the additional query string parameter =user.name=.

Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO authentication requires the user to perform a Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO authentication sequence.

If Pseudo/simple or Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO authentication mechanisms are used, Oozie will return the user an
authentication token HTTP Cookie that can be used in later requests as identy proof.

Oozie uses [[http://www.github.com/cloudera/alfredo][Alfredo, Java HTTP SPENGO]] library for authentication.
This library can be extended to support other authentication mechanisms.

Oozie user authentication is configured using the following configuration properties (default values shown):

<verbatim>
  oozie.authentication.type=simple
  oozie.authentication.token.validity=36000
  oozie.authentication.signature.secret=
  oozie.authentication.cookie.domain=
  oozie.authentication.simple.anonymous.allowed=true
  oozie.authentication.kerberos.principal=HTTP/localhost@${local.realm}
  oozie.authentication.kerberos.keytab=${oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.keytab.file}
</verbatim>

The =type= defines authentication used for Oozie HTTP endpoint, the supported values are:
simple | kerberos | #AUTHENTICATION_HANDLER_CLASSNAME#.

The =token.validity= indicates how long (in seconds) an authentication token is valid before it has
to be renewed.

The =signature.secret= is the signature secret for signing the authentication tokens. If not set a random
secret is generated at startup time.

The =oozie.authentication.cookie.domain= The domain to use for the HTTP cookie that stores the
authentication token. In order to authentiation to work correctly across all Hadoop nodes web-consoles
the domain must be correctly set.

The =simple.anonymous.allowed= indicates if anonymous requests are allowed. This setting is meaningful
only when using 'simple' authentication.

The =kerberos.principal= indicates the Kerberos principal to be used for HTTP endpoint.
The principal MUST start with 'HTTP/' as per Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO specification.

The =kerberos.keytab= indicates the location of the keytab file with the credentials for the principal.
It should be the same keytab file Oozie uses for its Kerberos credentials for Hadoop.

---+++ Oozie Hadoop Authentication Configuration

Oozie can work with Hadoop 20 with Security distribution which supports Kerberos authentication.

Oozie Hadoop authentication is configured using the following configuration properties (default values shown):

<verbatim>
  oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.kerberos.enabled=false
  local.realm=LOCALHOST
  oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.keytab.file=${user.home}/oozie.keytab
  oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.kerberos.principal=${user.name}/localhost@{local.realm}
</verbatim>

The above default values are for a Hadoop 0.20 secure distribution (with support for Kerberos authentication).

To use a Hadoop 20 distribution pre-security (i.e. 0.20.1) the following property must be set:

<verbatim>
  oozie.services.ext=org.apache.oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService
</verbatim>

To enable Kerberos authentication, the following property must be set:

<verbatim>
  oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.kerberos.enabled=true
</verbatim>

When using Kerberos authentication, the following properties must be set to the correct values (default values shown):

<verbatim>
  local.realm=LOCALHOST
  oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.keytab.file=${user.home}/oozie.keytab
  oozie.service.HadoopAccessorService.kerberos.principal=${user.name}/localhost@{local.realm}
</verbatim>

*IMPORTANT:* When using Oozie with a Hadoop 20 with Security distribution, the Oozie user in Hadoop must be configured
as a proxy user.

---+++ User Authorization Configuration

Oozie has a basic authorization model:

   * Users have read access to all jobs
   * Users have write access to their own jobs
   * Users have write access to jobs for groups the users belong to
   * Users have read access to admin operations
   * Admin users have write access to all jobs
   * Admin users have write access to admin operations

If security is disabled all users are admin users.

Oozie security is set via the following configuration property (default value shown):

<verbatim>
  oozie.service.AuthorizationService.security.enabled=false
</verbatim>

If security is enabled, the admin users are read from the =conf/adminusers.txt= file:

   * One user name per line
   * Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored

---+++ Oozie System ID Configuration

Oozie has a system ID that is is used to generate the Oozie temporary runtime directory, the workflow job IDs, and the
workflow action IDs.

Two Oozie systems running with the same ID will not have any conflict but in case of troubleshooting it will be easier
to identify resources created/used by the different Oozie systems if they have different system IDs (default value
shown):

<verbatim>
  oozie.system.id=oozie-${user.name}
</verbatim>

---+++ Fine Tuning an Oozie Server

Refer to the [[./oozie-default.xml][oozie-default.xml]] for details.

---++ Starting and Stopping Oozie

Use the standard Tomcat commands to start and stop Oozie.

---++ Oozie Command Line Installation

Copy and expand the =oozie-client= TAR.GZ file bundled with the distribution. Add the =bin/= directory to the =PATH=.

Refer to the [[DG_CommandLineTool][Command Line Interface Utilities]] document for a a full reference of the =oozie=
command line tool.

---++ Oozie Share Lib

The Oozie share lib TAR.GZ file bundled with the distribution contains the necessary files to run Oozie map-reduce
streaming and pig actions.

The bundled Streaming and Pig JARs are the ones used by Oozie testcases.

---++ Advanced/Custom Environment Settings

Oozie can be configured to use Unix standard filesystem hierarchy for its different files
(configuration, logs, data and temporary files).

These settings must be done in the =bin/oozie-env.sh= script.

This script is sourced before the configuration =oozie-env.sh= and supports additional
environment variables (shown with their default values):

<verbatim>
export OOZIE_CONF=${OOZIE_HOME}/conf
export OOZIE_DATA={OOZIE_HOME}/data
export OOZIE_LOG={OOZIE_HOME}/logs
export CATALINA_BASE=${OOZIE_HOME}/oozie-server
export CATALINA_TMPDIR=${OOZIE_HOME}/oozie-server/temp
export CATALINA_OUT=${OOZIE_LOGS}/catalina.out
export CATALINA_PID=/tmp/oozie.pid
</verbatim>

Sample values to make Oozie follow Unix standard filesystem hierarchy:

<verbatim>
export OOZIE_CONFIG=/etc/oozie
export OOZIE_DATA=/var/lib/oozie
export OOZIE_LOG=/var/log/oozie
export CATALINA_BASE=${OOZIE_DATA}/oozie-server
export CATALINA_TMPDIR=/tmp
export CATALINA_PID=/tmp/oozie.pid
</verbatim>
